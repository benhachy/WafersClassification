## Small intro:
The goal of the challenge, sponsored by STMicroelectronics in Kaggle, is to build a deep
learning model to classify images of errors in silicon wafers using a database of 8634
microscopic images of wafers.

## Results:
Ranked 3rd in the leaderboard with an accuracy of 98% (private score)
69 ms for inference time on GPU
